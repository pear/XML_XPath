  [*]     A more formal and informative interface to the load() function

  [*]     make an example.php and example.out for people to read through

  [*]     make a short test harness just so I know I don't commit bad shit
  
  [@]     prevent duplicate root in appendChild()
  
  [*]     finally figured out substitute entities default, so see if we can make this
          usable in the class

  [*]     implement getElementsByTagName and getElementById since there are domxml functions
          now

  [*]     considering doing substringData for attribute nodes...just seems to make sense

  [@]     sort for results
