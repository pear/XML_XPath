  [@]     implement siblingNode and childNode to get a tag by name

  [@]     sort for results

  [@]     A more formal and informative interface to the load() function, used 'file/string/object'

  [@]     prevent duplicate root in appendChild()
  
  [@]     make an example.php and example.out for people to read through (Cooker)

  [@]     implement childNodes() to return an xml_xpath_result object

  [*]     make a short test harness just so I know I don't commit bad shit
  
  [*]     finally figured out substitute entities default, so see if we can make this
          usable in the class

  [*]     implement getElementsByTagName and getElementById since there are domxml functions
          now

  [*]     considering doing substringData for attribute nodes...just seems to make sense

  [*]     in _quick_evaluate_init, make sure the pointer is not null, could happen coming
          off of a results object

  [*]     it would be better if getChildNodeByName() and getSiblingNodeByName() (not called that
          now, but should be called that) are result object generation functions...this way
          we can seperate the cache from getting mixed up in bad instances...word...
