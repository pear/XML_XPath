  [@]     implement siblingNode and childNode to get a tag by name

  [@]     sort for results

  [@]     A more formal and informative interface to the load() function, used 'file/string/object'

  [@]     prevent duplicate root in appendChild()
  
  [*]     make an example.php and example.out for people to read through

  [*]     make a short test harness just so I know I don't commit bad shit
  
  [*]     finally figured out substitute entities default, so see if we can make this
          usable in the class

  [*]     implement getElementsByTagName and getElementById since there are domxml functions
          now

  [*]     considering doing substringData for attribute nodes...just seems to make sense
